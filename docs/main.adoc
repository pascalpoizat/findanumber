Simply run:
[source, shell]
----
./gradlew run
----

**Note:** you must have Java 11 installed on your computer.

== What does ```findanumber``` do?

Well, not much (see <<App>>).

[#App,source,java,caption='{listing-caption} {counter:refnum}.',title=' The ```App``` class.']
----
public class App {

    private static final String GAME_HEADER = "Find a Number!";

    public static void game(int nombreATrouver) {
        System.out.println(String.format("Le nombre Ã©tait : %d", nombreATrouver));
        System.out.println("Game over!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(GAME_HEADER);
        int borneInf = 40;
        int borneSup = 50;
        int nombreATrouver = genererNombre(borneInf, borneSup);
        game(nombreATrouver);
    }

    private static int genererNombre(int borneInf, int borneSup) {
        int delta = 42;
        return 42;
    }
}
----

Still, it is quite fun to spend time playing with ```findanumber``` if you like number ```42```. Maybe soon available as an icon:android[] application.

== Last comments

Some books recommended with the course.

To learn all about design patterns, refer to the book by the "`Gang of Four`" <<gof>>.
Good practices are important. See <<ej3>> for example.
Some people refer to _The Pragmatic Programmer_ <<pp>>, that should be required reading for all developers. I still have to check this one.
